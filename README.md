# Recognizing-Shapes-in-Images-with-OpenCV

This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1.5 hour to finish. 

# Course Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on five learning objectives:

By the end of task 1, you will be able to load an image from file.
By the end of task 2, you will be able to compute image gradients.
By the end of task 3, you will be able to detect edges in an image.
By the end of task 4, you will be able to recognize lines in an image using Hough transforms.
By the end of task 5, you will be able to recognize circles in an image using Hough transforms.
By the end of this course, you will be able to work with a real-world digital image, process it using computer vision techniques and use Hough tranforms to detect shapes.

# Course Structure

The hands on project on Recognizing Shapes in Images with OpenCV is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Load an image from file

Task 2: Compute image gradients

Task 3: Detect edges in an image

Task 4: Recognize lines in an image

Task 5: Recognize circles in an image
